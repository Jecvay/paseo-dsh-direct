# Changelog

## 0.1.1

- Dropped the `@xmoon76/dsh-pi-tui` dependency; the plugin now runs its own `paseo` DSH profile instead of injecting into a pi-tui profile.
- Renamed the repository and plugin id to `paseo-dsh-direct`.
- The plugin's version now tracks the dsh version line (`major.minor`); a mismatched or unconfirmed dsh version shows a warning in the Paseo timeline instead of blocking the session.
