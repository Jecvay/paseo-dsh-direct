# Changelog

## 0.1.3

- Fixed: tool approvals and user questions never reached Paseo and the turn stayed running. The `api-remotes` row of the web template forwarded both requests to browser clients ahead of the bridge; the plugin now disables it along with the other web surface rows.

## 0.1.2

- Fixed: 0.1.1 failed to load in Paseo because a server module imported `package.json`, which lies outside `client/`, `server/` and `shared/`. The plugin version is now generated into `server/generated-version.ts` by `npm run build`. Do not install the `v0.1.1` tag.
- Added a test that fails when a plugin module imports a file outside those three directories.

## 0.1.1

- Dropped the `@xmoon76/dsh-pi-tui` dependency; the plugin now runs its own `paseo` DSH profile instead of injecting into a pi-tui profile.
- Renamed the repository and plugin id to `paseo-dsh-direct`.
- The plugin's version now tracks the dsh version line (`major.minor`); a mismatched or unconfirmed dsh version shows a warning in the Paseo timeline instead of blocking the session.
